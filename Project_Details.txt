YouTube Data Analysis Pipeline

This project consists of comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing YouTube data. This pipeline was developed using a combination of AWS services, Python, and PySpark to process, transform, and visualize large datasets.  

Key Technologies Used:

◆ Kaggle- YouTube data from Kaggle was utilized as the foundation for the analysis.  
◆ AWS S3 - Amazon S3 was leveraged for secure and scalable storage of raw data.  
◆ AWS IAM - IAM roles were employed to manage secure access and permissions across services.  
◆ AWS Athena - Athena was utilized for efficient querying of large datasets stored in S3 using SQL-like syntax.  
◆ AWS Glue - ETL jobs were designed and run with Glue to transform and clean the data.  
◆ AWS Lambda - Serverless compute operations were orchestrated using Lambda functions to streamline the workflow.  
◆ Python & PySpark - Python with PySpark was applied for data processing, transformation, and analysis at scale.  
◆ AWS QuickSight - Processed data was visualized, transforming it into actionable insights using QuickSight.  

Project Goals:
- Insights such as view counts, engagement rates, and trending topics were extracted from YouTube data.  
- Data processing and analysis were automated within a scalable architecture.  
- Key trends and metrics were visualized to facilitate data-driven decision-making.  

Outcome : 
By combining these AWS tools and leveraging the power of PySpark, a robust pipeline capable of handling large datasets efficiently was created. Dashboards in AWS QuickSight were developed to provide real-time insights into YouTube trends, enabling content optimization and audience engagement strategies.
